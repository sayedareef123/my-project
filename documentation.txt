simple project to enter userdata and store in database

create a vpc with one public subnet and one private subnet

create a instance in public subnet 
here public instance will be used to host the frontend application
which will collect the data
 
 here we are using 
 nginx to host the frontend application 
 node.js to connect backend to frontend with MySql database

below commands can be used for installing above mentioned applications and tools
 for nginx 

 	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install nginx
	sudo systemctl start nginx
	sudo systemctl enable nginx
 
 for node

 	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install nodejs npm mysql-client
	
      Create a New Node.js Project
	
	mkdir simple-backend
	cd simple-backend
	npm init -y
	npm install express body-parser mysql2
	npm install cors



create a instance in private subnet 
here we can store the data submitted from the frontend application


 to login to the private instance we must use the public instance only 
  in public instance copy the pem key for connecting with the private instance
  ssh into private instance using command below
  
	ssh -i <pem-key> ubuntu@private-ip
	
  here we are using mysql-server to store the data
	      
  below commands can be used for installing above mentioned applications and tools

 for mysql-server
 	
	sudo apt update

     Install MySQL server:
	
	sudo apt install mysql-server -y

     Start MySQL service:
	
	sudo systemctl start mysql
	sudo systemctl enable mysql

  Edit the MySQL configuration to allow remote connections:

        
	sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

    Find the line: bind-address = 127.0.0.1
    Change it to: bind-address = 0.0.0.0

  Restart MySQL to apply the changes:
    sudo systemctl restart mysql


  Login to MySQL:
     sudo mysql -u root -p


  Create a new user (replace your-secure-password with your desired password):

     CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-secure-password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   
  Exit MySQL:
     EXIT;


    Create the Database and Table in MySQL

	mysql -u admin -p
	
	CREATE DATABASE user_data_db;
	USE user_data_db;

	CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(100),
	age INT,
	email VARCHAR(100)
	);

        EXIT;

remember the databse username, password, and database name 




by these steps the setup must be almost ready to host the front end application


in the public instance add sample index.html which is the form asking name,age,email-id 

the index.html must be added in the following default nginx path which is /var/www/html/

after adding restart nginx

at the begining we have created a directory called simple-backend and installed necessary node files,
here create a server.js file and add the contents given with this file    

make sure to configure db part in the server.js as per you configurations

start the server.js using below command
	
	node server.js
   
   this will run in the foreground

we can now access the 
frontend using  = public_ip ---> will return the sample form to submit details
backend using  = public_ip:3000 (the port mentioned in server.js) ----> will return "Backend is working!"

now to check if the data is storing in the MySql server or not
we can 
ssh into the private instance again and
login to mysql user and 
select the database
and select the table
